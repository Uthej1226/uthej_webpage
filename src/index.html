        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Random numbers are essential for a wide range of applications, including cryptography, simulation, and scientific computing. While there are many ways to generate random numbers, true random number generators (TRNGs) are widely regarded as the most secure and reliable. In this paper, we explore the use of resistive random access memory (ReRAM) as a source of TRNGs. We discuss the formation of ReRAM arrays and demonstrate how the noise they produce can be used to generate random numbers. We also explore the potential applications of ReRAM-based TRNGs and their advantages over other TRNG technologies.</p>

        <h2>TRNGs from ReRAM Arrays</h2>
        <p>ReRAM is a non-volatile memory technology that exhibits resistive switching behavior. This means that the resistance of ReRAM cells can be switched between high and low states by applying appropriate voltage pulses. The switching process is inherently stochastic, resulting in variability in the resistance levels of individual ReRAM cells. This variability can be leveraged to generate random numbers.</p>
        <p>To generate random numbers from ReRAM arrays, we exploit the inherent noise present in the resistive switching process. By measuring the resistance of multiple ReRAM cells in an array, we can extract the noise component, which exhibits characteristics of a random process. This noise can then be processed to generate high-quality random numbers.</p>
        <p>ReRAM-based TRNGs offer several advantages over other TRNG technologies. Firstly, ReRAM cells have small area requirements, enabling the integration of large numbers of cells in a compact space. This is particularly beneficial for applications where physical size is a constraint, such as embedded systems or Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Secondly, ReRAM-based TRNGs consume low power, making them suitable for battery-powered devices or energy-efficient systems. Finally, ReRAM has inherent reliability due to its non-volatile nature, ensuring consistent performance over time.</p>

        <h2>Applications of ReRAM-based TRNGs</h2>
        <p>ReRAM-based TRNGs have potential applications in various fields, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cryptography:</strong> Random numbers are crucial for cryptographic algorithms, such as key generation, encryption, and authentication. ReRAM-based TRNGs can provide a reliable source of random numbers for cryptographic applications.</li>
            <li><strong>Machine Learning:</strong> Random numbers are frequently used in machine learning algorithms for tasks like initialization, regularization, and sampling. ReRAM-based TRNGs can enhance the randomness required for these applications.</li>
            <li><strong>Simulation and Modeling:</strong> Many simulations and computational models rely on random numbers for accurate and realistic results. ReRAM-based TRNGs can improve the quality of random numbers used in these simulations.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

        <h2>TRNG’s:</h2>
        <p>TRNG stands for True Random Number Generator. It is a hardware device that generates random numbers based on a physical process that is inherently random, such as thermal noise, radioactive decay, or quantum phenomena. TRNGs are used in various applications where unpredictable, non-deterministic, and unbiased random numbers are required, such as cryptography, computer simulations, statistical sampling, and gaming.</p>
        <p>Unlike pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) that use deterministic algorithms to generate seemingly random numbers, TRNGs produce genuinely random numbers that are not predictable or repeatable. This makes TRNGs more secure and reliable for applications that require high-quality random numbers. However, TRNGs may have some limitations, such as low throughput, high power consumption, and susceptibility to environmental noise or interference. Therefore, the choice of TRNG design and implementation should consider various factors such as performance, security, cost, and practicality.</p>

		<p>
		Reinforcement learning is a form of machine learning
		method in which an agent is trained to execute behaviors in
		an environment in order to maximize a reward signal. The
		agent learns by trial and error, altering its behavior in response
		to feedback from its surroundings. In the context of intrusion
		detection systems, reinforcement learning may be used to teach
		an agent to identify and mitigate intrusions. This method is
		beneficial when the IDS is operating in a dynamic environment
		with changing threats and attack patterns.
		</p>

		<p>
		Each of these systems has advantages and disadvantages
		and is appropriate for different sorts of intrusion detection
		scenarios. The technique chosen is determined on the nature of
		the data and the sort of attack that the IDS is meant to detect.
		In the sections that follow, we will go through each of these
		techniques in greater depth and emphasize their contributions
		to the development of ML-based IDSs.

        <h2>Background:</h2>
        <p>TRNGs generate random numbers by measuring unpredictable physical phenomena, such as thermal noise or radioactive decay. However, traditional TRNGs often require expensive hardware and have limited performance. ReRAM is a promising technology for TRNGs because it generates random noise as a byproduct of its operation. ReRAM is also low-power and has small area requirements, making it a good candidate for embedded systems.</p>

    <section>
    
        <h2>Methodology:</h2>
        <p>We formed ReRAM arrays using standard fabrication techniques and measured the noise produced by the arrays under different conditions. We then processed the noise data using statistical tests to evaluate its randomness and entropy. Finally, we compared the performance of ReRAM-based TRNGs with other TRNG technologies.</p>  
	</section>
    <section>
    
        <h2>Results:</h2>

    <section>

They are also more cost-effective and energy-efficient than traditional TRNG technologies. However, there are still some limitations to the technology, including issues with variability and reliability. Future research should focus on improving the reliability and consistency of ReRAM-based TRNGs, as well as exploring their potential applications in other fields.</p>

        <h2>Open Problems and Future Directions</h2>
        <p>While ReRAM-based TRNGs show promise, there are still open problems and challenges that need to be addressed. Some of these include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Characterization of Noise:</strong> Further research is needed to understand and characterize the noise properties of ReRAM arrays for different operating conditions and fabrication processes.</li>

            <li><strong>Bias Mitigation:</strong> Techniques to mitigate any biases present in the generated random numbers need to be explored and implemented.</li>
            <li><strong>Security Analysis:</strong> Thorough security analysis is required to assess the vulnerability of ReRAM-based TRNGs to various attacks and potential countermeasures.</li>
            <li><strong>Integration Challenges:</strong> Integration of ReRAM-based TRNGs into existing systems and architectures may pose challenges related to compatibility, reliability, and scalability.</li>
        </ul>

    <p>
        Headings were used to create a hierarchical structure within each <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>. This enables
        readers to navigate the paper efficiently and understand the relationships between different sections.
    </p>
